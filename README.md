# OS-PROJECT
This project is regarding the use and implementation of threads(light weighted process) in the programs. The program under this project also shows how race condition occurs and how to tackle with them. I have used Mutex for removing race condition. The question is :Write a multithreaded program in C that outputs prime numbers. This program should work as follows: The user will run the program and will enter a number on the command line. The program will then create a separate thread that outputs all the prime numbers less than or equal to the number entered by the user.
